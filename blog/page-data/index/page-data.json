It's a nicely spun historic sports drama based on two footballers striving to shape football for the better while struggling in their own personal lives. The English Game keeps you hooked to your seat with its mild cliff-hangers knowing it only contains 6 episodes which is like an extra long movie.</p><p>Based on the lives of footballers <em><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fergus_Suter\">Fergus \"Fergie\" Suter</a></strong> </em>and <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Kinnaird,_11th_Lord_Kinnaird\"><em>Arthur Kinnaird</em></a>, </strong>rivals in football teams <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwen_F.C.\"><strong><em>Darwen FC</em></strong></a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEU_enIN854IN854&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03I6kQ9IQGTTFoG8gmSRATiC3us5w:1584910619374&amp;q=Old+Etonians&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwigud-T_K7oAhXFe30KHdteCmIQkeECKAB6BAgaECc\"><strong><em>Old Etonians</em></strong></a><strong><em>; </em></strong><em>how they struggle to keep playing in the FA Cup amid troubles in their own personal lives.</em></p><h2 id=\"synopsis\">Synopsis</h2><p> <strong><em>Suter </em></strong>comes from a working class family where his father is a recurring alcoholic with the history of violence. He comes from Scottish football club \"Partick\" at the behest of Mr. Welsh who is offers to pay him better (later he joins another FC <strong>Blackburn </strong>for even better compensation to provide for his family, for which he even faces backlash from everybody from the old teammates to the common folk), who is an owner at a cotton mill in Darwen and is responsible for Darwen F.C.. Suter brings his best friend Jimmy Love along with him to play for Darwen F.C.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Kinnaird,_11th_Lord_Kinnaird\"><em>Arthur Kinnaird</em></a><em> </em></strong><em>comes from a wealthy banking family and is a founding member of the Old Etonians F.C.. His personal life is a mess, as his wife recently lost their child and his father doesn't approve of his greater affection for the game. He is struggling to strike a balance between being a good husband to his wife and being a football player, and also to deal with his father.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/omtmgjm/2020/03/englsh-game.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>A still from \"The English Game\"</figcaption></figure><p>Both characters have daddy issues, but are motivated to do good by their families and their love for football. Both leads their respective teams and have to deal with their team mates who don't always support their actions. Despite these challenges they are trying their hard to keep all the pots stirring. Suter has his eyes on winning FA Cup for his team (which consists of some professional and working men), Football Association controlled by \"gentlemen\" frown upon this i.e. the professional players who play football for money to keep the stature of game.</p><p>This leads to banning Blackburn F.C. from the FA Cup final against OLD Etonians, but after some staunch opposition from <em>Mr. Kinnaird and Lancashire Football Association </em>they are ultimately allowed to play.</p><h2 id=\"the-verdict\">The Verdict</h2><p> <strong><em>The </em></strong><em>thing which</em> I like most, how this whole series connects everyone to Football (which is what the original motive would have been), main characters and everybody around them is somehow committed to the GAME and that includes the common people of Darwen and Blackburn. Every character is created beautifully, which you could say are essential to the being of this series. Though it is a historic piece, it doesn't involve anything which is unrelated to the football scene of the time. The actors playing Suter and <em>Kinnaird </em>have done full justice to their respective characters.<br>Even after all these discerning facts about this TV show, the only thing which somewhat bothered me the fast pace of this series, which would have been unnoticeable if it were a movie, but the sad fact is it's a TV show and it would have even elevated the whole watching experience of the show.<br><br>All in all, this TV series is a very well executed work and I recommend watching it for everyone, who loves the GAME or who are just looking for something to watch on their weekend.</p><p><strong><strong>Original article on:</strong> </strong><a href=\"https://blog.kushalbhalaik.xyz/the-english-game-review/\">https://blog.kushalbhalaik.xyz/the-english-game-review/</a></p>","url":"https://admin.kushalbhalaik.xyz/the-english-game-review/","uuid":"28e79ebb-8936-4c58-aece-f471733b4048","page":false,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5e777078251b95000153dcdf"}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5e6932c6d0c35a000177b347","title":"Allthestreams.fm - a necessary evil?","slug":"allthestreams-fm-a-new","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/omtmgjm/2020/03/allthe.png","excerpt":"My first reaction was, twas' gonna happen one day.

Commençons!!\n\n> Before proceeding make sure you already have a repository\n<your_username>.github.io\nSetting up Multiple Github Pages:\nLet’s create a new repository:\n\n 1. Goto Github.new [http://www.github.new/] and fill out the new repository\n    details, I’ll call it “demo”:\n\nRepository creation flow on GitHubNote: It is important to keep this repository\npublic\n2. Now goto repository settings:\n\n3. On Settings page, scroll down to Github Pages section:\n\nGitHub Repo Settings Page4. Make the repository Public, if you see following\nmessage:\n\nMaking Repository Public on GitHub5. Once repository is Public GitHub Pages will become enabled for the current\nrepository\n\nGitHub Pages options6. Click on None, then view current options: we can either choose following\noptions:\n\n 1. Using “master” branch of demo repository for publishing GitHub pages (Like\n    in GitHub User Pages)\n 2. Using /docs page under “master” branch for publishing GitHub Pages\n 3. We’ll be using gh-pages branch option which is currently not available as \n    gh-pages branch doesn’t exist for demo repository as of yet\n\nBy default None is selected for GitHub Pages7. Copy the demo repository link:\n\nCopying repository link from GitHub8. Now clone the repo to local machine: Here, <far11ven>\n[unsafe:javascript:void(0)] is my GitHub username\n\n~$ git clone https://github.com/far11ven/demo.git\n\n9. Create local gh-pages branch and push it to GitHub:\n\n~$ cd demo\n~$ git branch gh-pages\n~$ git push remote -u origin gh-pages\n\n10. Go back to demo settings on GitHub and select gh-pages as source for\npublishing:\n\nSelecting gh-pages branchAfter this step whatever you put in gh-pages branch will be automatically\npublished.\n\n11. Let’s create a simple index.html file within this repository:\n\n~$ echo \"Hello gh-pages!!\" > index.html\n\n12. Add, commit and push your changes to GithHub remote:\n\n13. You can see in your browser demo repository has been published\n\n“demo” page published under GitHub User page> You will have a main GitHub User\nPage (One per account) <username>.github.io and all other repos will be\npublished as sub pages\n\nor,\n\nif you have already linked a custom-domain to your GitHub User Page, the n you\ncan see the published page at www.example.com/<your-repo-name> in my case demo \nrepo will be published at far11ven.github.io/demo\nSetting up custom-domains:\n\ni) Setting up Github Pages as a domain\nTo have our subpages be listed as demo page we need to do following changes in\nour GitHub repo and our Domain provider\n\n 1. Create a CNAME file in your repository: I will be doing it via GitHub UI,\n    just create a CNAME file (with no extension) and just enter your sub-domain\n    name inside it, nothing else. in my case, I want to make demo pages appear\n    as your-website.com\n\nCNAME File contentOnce Done, commit your changes.\n\nAdding CNAME to repositoryAfter Adding CNAME to repo2.  Add a new DNS record on\nyour DNS provider: We need to change existing CNAME records to point to created\nGitHub pages i.e. .github.io\n\nAdding new CNAME DNS record on Cloudflareii) Setting up Github Pages as a\nsub-domain:\nTo have our subpages be listed as demo page we need to do following changes in\nour GitHub repo and our Domain provider\n\n 1. Create or Edit an existing CNAME file in your repository: I will be doing it\n    via GitHub UI, in my case, there is already a CNAME File so I ‘ll just edit\n    the existing file and replace everything in it with my sub-domain, nothing\n    else. in my case, I want to make demo pages appear as demo.kushalbhalaik.xyz\n\nUpdated CNAME File ContentOnce Done, commit your changes.\n\nEditing CNAME file in RepositoryAfter Adding CNAME to repo2. Add a new DNS\nrecord on your DNS provider for existing Domain: We need to change existing\nCNAME records to point to created GitHub pages i.e. .github.io\n\nImportant Points:\n * Again, at this point, nothing needs to be done from our end, we need to wait\n   for changes to reflect on both GitHub and Cloudflare end, Which may take some\n   time (usually its prompt) but may take some time based on your DNS provider\n * You won’t be able to access your pages via <username>.github.io, or\n   <username>.github.io/<your-repo> in case you try and enter this in browser,\n   you’ll be redirected to your custom domain or custom sub-domain\n * Your can-not add multiple GitHub Pages as a sub-doman to GitHub User Page i.e \n   demo.far11ven.github.io in my case is not a valid url\n\nFinal Result:\nWe have successfully created a sub-domain to host our another github-page,\nfollow these steps to create even more pages within your website.\n\nGitHub pages published under a sub-domainCheers!!\n\nOriginal article on: \nhttps://blog.kushalbhalaik.xyz/github-pages-a-comprehensive-guide-w-images-part-2","html":"<p>This is part 2 of the article series <a href=\"https://blog.kushalbhalaik.xyz/github-pages-a-comprehensive-guide-w-images-part-1\">GitHub Pages — A Comprehensive guide w/ images</a></p><p>Recently I started building my personal <a href=\"https://kushalbhalaik.xyz/\">website</a> as everyone is building one for themselves these days.

Enchanté.\n\nSetting up Github Pages:\nThis is the most straight forward thing, it’s all neatly illustrated here on \nGithub Pages [https://pages.github.com/], but as this article‘s name suggests\nI’m bound:\n\nWe’ll start by creating a repository on Github:\n\n 1. Goto Github.new [https://github.com/new/], a cooler way to create Github\n    repositories (You’ll see).\n\nMake sure your repo-name is .github.io The pages ending with .github.io are\ncalled User Pages, where could belong to an individual or an organization\n\nRepository creation flow on GitHubNote: It is important to make your repository\nPublic, in order for your GitHub User pages to be accessible to all\n\n> We won’t be creating any other branch, because User Pages require to be built\nfrom master branch. And in this article, we won’t use Jekyll to publish our\npages.\n 1. First clone the repo to local machine: Here, <username\n    [unsafe:javascript:void(0)]> is GitHub username\n\n~$ git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git\n\n 1. Create an index.html file inside this repository:\n\n~$ cd username.github.io\n\n~$ echo “Hello World!!” > index.html\n\n 1. Add, commit and push your changes to Github remote:\n\n~$ git add *\n\n~$ git commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n\n~$ git push -u origin master\n\n 1. Type {<username>.github.io } in browser and you’re done publishing your\n    first website to github pages.\n\nBrowser screenshot of deployed Github pages\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSetting up Github Pages on your custom-domain:\nWe have successfully created and deployed Github Pages. But I want users to\nvisit my custom domain kushalbhalaik.xyz. Lets link’em up:\n\n 1. Created a CNAME file in your repository: I will be doing it via GitHub UI,\n    just create a CNAME file (with no extension) and just enter your domain name\n    inside it, nothing else.\n\nOnce Done, commit your changes.\n\nAdding CNAME file to repository 1. Change DNS records on your DNS provider: We\n    need to change existing CNAME records to point to created github pages i.e. \n    <username>.github.io\n\nChanging CNAME records on CloudflareImportant Points:\n * At this point, nothing needs to be done from our end, we need to wait for\n   changes to reflect on both GitHub and Cloudflare end, Which may take some\n   time (usually its prompt) but may take some time based on your DNS provider\n * You won’t be able to access your pages via .github.io, in case you try and\n   enter this in browser, you’ll be redirected to your custom domain\n\nGithub Page deployed on custom-domainSo this was all to get you started with\nyour very own Github Pages (User). In Part 2 of this series we’ll be taking\ndeeper look into gh-pages and linking pages to your sub-domain.\n\nPart 2 is now available here\n[https://blog.kushalbhalaik.xyz/github-pages-a-comprehensive-guide-w-images-part-2/]\n.
